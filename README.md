## What I learned from this project
* Through this project, I learned to use HTML elements and tags, and also learned how to position them using CSS.
* In this project, I learned to position two or three images respectfully to each other. When I was trying to set one image, the other was getting displaced, and when I tried to adjust the second one, the third one was getting replaced.
